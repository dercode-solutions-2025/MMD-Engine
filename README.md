# MMD
MMD, short for My MarkDown, is a simple text formatting engine that converts to HTML. It was mostly made as a beginner project for these reasons:
* To learn JS
* I thought markdown was too hard
# Usage:
Simply enter an html command, a dollar sign ($), and the text you want to enter. For example:
``
p $ Hello World!
`` \
Converts to: \
``<p> Hello World!</p>``
